# Bootstrapping the etcd Cluster

Kubernetes components are stateless and store cluster state in [etcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd). In this lab you will bootstrap a three node etcd cluster and configure it for high availability and secure remote access.

## Prerequisites

The commands in this lab must be run on each controller instance: `controller-0`, `controller-1`, and `controller-2`. Login to each controller instance using the `gcloud` command. Example:

```
gcloud compute ssh controller-0
```

### Running commands in parallel with tmux

[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) can be used to run commands on multiple compute instances at the same time. See the [Running commands in parallel with tmux](01-prerequisites.md#running-commands-in-parallel-with-tmux) section in the Prerequisites lab.

## Bootstrapping an etcd Cluster Member

### Download and Install the etcd Binaries

Download the official etcd release binaries from the [etcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd) GitHub project:

```
wget -q --show-progress --https-only --timestamping \
  "https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/download/v3.4.15/etcd-v3.4.15-linux-amd64.tar.gz"
```

Extract and install the `etcd` server and the `etcdctl` command line utility:

```
{
  tar -xvf etcd-v3.4.15-linux-amd64.tar.gz
  sudo mv etcd-v3.4.15-linux-amd64/etcd* /usr/local/bin/
}
```

### Configure the etcd Server

```
{
  sudo mkdir -p /etc/etcd /var/lib/etcd
  sudo chmod 700 /var/lib/etcd
  sudo cp ca.pem kubernetes-key.pem kubernetes.pem /etc/etcd/
}
```

The instance internal IP address will be used to serve client requests and communicate with etcd cluster peers. Retrieve the internal IP address for the current compute instance:

```
INTERNAL_IP=$(curl -s -H "Metadata-Flavor: Google" \
  http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/network-interfaces/0/ip)
```

Each etcd member must have a unique name within an etcd cluster. Set the etcd name to match the hostname of the current compute instance:

```
ETCD_NAME=$(hostname -s)
```

Create the `etcd.service` systemd unit file:

```
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/etcd.service
[Unit]
Description=etcd
Documentation=https://github.com/coreos

[Service]
Type=notify
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/etcd \\
  --name ${ETCD_NAME} \\
  --cert-file=/etc/etcd/kubernetes.pem \\

  --initial-cluster controller-0=https://10.240.0.10:2380,controller-1=https://10.240.0.11:2380,controller-2=https://10.240.0.12:2380 \\
  --initial-cluster-state new \\
  --data-dir=/var/lib/etcd
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
```

### Start the etcd Server

```
{
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  sudo systemctl enable etcd
  sudo systemctl start etcd
}
```

> Remember to run the above commands on each controller node: `controller-0`, `controller-1`, and `controller-2`.

## Verification

List the etcd cluster members:

```
sudo ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl member list \
  --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
  --cacert=/etc/etcd/ca.pem \
  --cert=/etc/etcd/kubernetes.pem \
  --key=/etc/etcd/kubernetes-key.pem
```

> output

```
3a57933972cb5131, started, controller-2, https://10.240.0.12:2380, https://10.240.0.12:2379, false
f98dc20bce6225a0, started, controller-0, https://10.240.0.10:2380, https://10.240.0.10:2379, false
ffed16798470cab5, started, controller-1, https://10.240.0.11:2380, https://10.240.0.11:2379, false
```

!! The setup all worked perfectly but I am surprised about one thing...
The output shown above is _identical_ to mine. Both are in the same order 2,0,1, and they also have the exact same member id hashes. A quick google about etc member naming conventions landed me on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63433622/is-the-following-output-of-etcdctl-member-list-correct-and-etcd-cluster-is-in where the person asking the question _also has the exact same output_ regardless of wihch host I run the member list command on, every time. I guess I can accept that the 2,0,1 ordering is a one-in-6 chance of the sequence that the processes booted, but the hashes have a much lower collision rate....It's too short to be an md5, it's not a truncated version of `echo "controller-2" | md5` ...
